# Shell

This is my Bash-like Shell that I created in C.  It supports builtin commands, executables, unlimited piping and redirection, and job control. 

## Compilation

Run `make` in the directory with the Makefile.  Binaries are created within the `bin/` folder.

## Usage

Launch the shell with the shell script: `bin/sfish`
